-----------------------------------

- Added `PUT /snmpsim/mgmt/v1/recordings/<recording>` endpoint which (unlike
  POST) will create new or override existing recording.
- When creating new recordings, also create all directories leading to the
  recording being created. When recording is deleted, try to also remove
  its directory if it's empty.
- Fixed WSGI servers default config initialization.
