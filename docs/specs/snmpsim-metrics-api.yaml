  title: 'SNMP Simulator Metrics REST API'
  description: >
    Metrics API provides the insight for the operator to how SNMP Simulator
    is doing. That includes health reporting and operational statistics.
    The data is provided by running SNMP Simulator, REST API is essentially
    read-only.


    The `/processes` endpoint exposes the details on SNMP simulator health
    as a set of UNIX processes. It's mostly concern with processes being
    present, resources being consumed reasonably and internal faults noted.


    Typical use of the `/processes` endpoint by some monitoring application
    can be a parameterized REST API call designed to reveal crashing processes,
    overly consumed system resources or serious application-specific errors
    occurring in SNMP simulator.


    The `/activity` endpoints report SNMP traffic counters optionally filtered
    by one or more attributes. Conceptually, any SNMP command traverses simulator
    subsystems in order

    1. network transport

    2. agent

    3. recording

    4. variation module


    Each subsystem extract certain attributes from the passing traffic by
    which `/activity/packets` and `/activity/messages` endpoints can filter
    reported counters.


    Available filters applicable to specific endpoint can be discovered via
    `/activity/{packets, messages}/filters` endpoint.


    For example, user can get packet count for all agents or for a single
    specific agent, for agent+endpoint combination (an agent can listen on
    multiple endpoints) or for agent+recording pair (any single recording can
    be used by many agents).


    The consumer of `/activity/*` endpoints is expected to poll the API
    periodically pushing collected data into a time-series database for
    dynamics computing and data aggregation.


    Although reported counters are ever growing, the consumer should be
    prepared to handle the situation when the counters are reset to zero
    abruptly.
